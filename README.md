# User-Onboarding 
This project utilizes advanced form management to achieve creating a simple, yet highly functioning user-onboarding process.

## Motivation
I created this project out of wanting to challenge myself to have a more dynamic UI and UX. Additionally, I wanted to simulate the process of a new user. This project deals with the first steps of any user; signing up, and being directly to a page with their information. From that point whatever service is being provided can easily be infused in the code.

I love taking the time to make something look really professional and well-done. This project was a blast to make start to finish. It was a fun challenge and I can't wait to add more to it.

I utilized React, React-Router, ReactStrap, Bootstrap, and Styled-components for the styling and the framework.
I then used yup for validation on my form and axios to post form data onto a small user interface. This application only allows one user at a time and has a logout feature in order to return to the sign in screen.
In my Tests-Cypress repo, I have all the relevant E-2-E tests written comprehensively.
